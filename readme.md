QR Code
-------

Code should encode a url which can be used to fetch a Json object containing
all doc information:

```
    page_size = A4_SIZE
    checkbox_size = (12, 10)
    qr_size = (24, 24)
    qr_offset = (14, 14)
    fields = (
        "Is this a questionnaire?",
        "The seminar does a good job integrating.",
        "I made new professional contacts.",
        "One final question."
    )
```
